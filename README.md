Easy Redirector is a Chrome extension designed to boost productivity by redirecting users away from time-wasting websites. It leverages Chrome's extension capabilities to provide a seamless and customizable experience for managing your focus and productivity.

## Features

- **Website Redirection:** Automatically redirects you from blacklisted websites to a more productive site of your choice.
- **Customizable Options:** Through the [options page](options/options.html), users can easily add or remove websites from the redirection list.
- **Visual Feedback:** A popup UI ([popup.html](popup/popup.html)) provides quick access to the extension's features and settings.
- **Content Scripting:** Utilizes content scripts ([content.js](scripts/content.js)) to detect and redirect web page requests in real-time.
